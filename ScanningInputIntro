Reading data with a scanner: 

The simplest way to obtain data from the standard input is to use the standard class: Scanner.
To use the scanner you must add to the code: 


 
 //This goes to the top
import java.util.Scanner; 


//And this under the Public satic void. 
Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);   

With this line, we create an object of Scanner class, 
that enables us to use its methods. 


There are two ways to read strings with a Scanner class. 
If your wanted input is an integer number or a single word, you can use next() method.

As an example: 

 String name = scanner.next();
System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "!");

BUT

If you want to it to scan and print more then one word, 
you have to use the nextLine() method. 


-- example of the diffrence --

import java.util.Scanner; 

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);  

        String word1 = scanner.next(); // "This"
        String line1 = scanner.nextLine(); // " is a simple" 
        String word2 = scanner.next(); // "multiline"
        String word3 = scanner.next(); // "input,"
        String line2 = scanner.nextLine(); // "" 
        
        
    }
 }

                                  ------------ TASK 1 -------------
                                  
                                 
Write a program that reads three strings and outputs them in the reverse order, each in a new line.
      
      
import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        String word1 = scanner.next(); // "Java"
        String word2 = scanner.next(); // "Programming"
        String word3 = scanner.next(); // "Language"
        
        System.out.println(word3);
        System.out.println(word2);
        System.out.println(word1); 
        
    }
}

                               ----- TASK 2 -----
Imagine that you are an HR manager at a restaurant and you need to hire a chef. To do that, you need to collect some data about the candidates.
You have a special form for the candidates that includes 3 fields: first name, years of experience and cuisine preference.
Your program should read all the words (or numbers) from the three lines 
and output:

"The form for first name is completed. We will contact you if we need a chef who cooks cuisine preference dishes and has years of experience years of experience." 



import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        String name = scanner.next();
        String experience = scanner.next();
        String dishes = scanner.next();

        System.out.print("The form for " + name + " is completed. We will contact you if we need a chef who cooks ");
        System.out.println(dishes + " dishes and has " + experience + " years of experience.");
    }
}
     (Println means next line.)
