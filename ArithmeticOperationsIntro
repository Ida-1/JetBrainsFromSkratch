Here are the diffrent math signs to use;

    addition +
    subtraction -
    multiplication *
    integer division /
    remainder %
    
    
The operators are called binary because they take two values as operands.

The following example prints results of addition, subtraction, and multiplication.

System.out.println(13 + 25); // prints 38
System.out.println(20 + 70); // prints 90

System.out.println(70 - 30); // prints 40
System.out.println(30 - 70); // prints -40

System.out.println(21 * 3);  // prints 63
System.out.println(20 * 10); // prints 200

----

Let's look at some examples below.

int two = 2;
int ten = 10;

int twelve = two + ten; // 12
int eight = ten - two;  // 8
int twenty = two * ten; // 20
int five = ten / two;   // 5
int zero = ten % two;   // 0, no remainder

int minusTwo = -two; // -2

You can also print out a line with math, like this:

System.out.println(1 + 3 * 4 - 2); // prints 11

The calculation order coincides with arithmetic rules. 
Multiplication has a higher priority level than addition and subtraction, 
so the operation 3 * 4 is calculated first.
To specify the order of execution we can use parentheses as in the following:

System.out.println((1 + 3) * (4 - 2)); // prints 8

This is a list of highest to lowest priorities; 


    parentheses
    unary plus/minus
    multiplication, division
    addition, subtraction
