Here are the diffrent math signs to use;

    addition +
    subtraction -
    multiplication *
    integer division /
    remainder %
    
    
The operators are called binary because they take two values as operands.

The following example prints results of addition, subtraction, and multiplication.

System.out.println(13 + 25); // prints 38
System.out.println(20 + 70); // prints 90

System.out.println(70 - 30); // prints 40
System.out.println(30 - 70); // prints -40

System.out.println(21 * 3);  // prints 63
System.out.println(20 * 10); // prints 200

----

Let's look at some examples below.

int two = 2;
int ten = 10;

int twelve = two + ten; // 12
int eight = ten - two;  // 8
int twenty = two * ten; // 20
int five = ten / two;   // 5
int zero = ten % two;   // 0, no remainder

int minusTwo = -two; // -2

---

You can also print out a line with math, like this:

System.out.println(1 + 3 * 4 - 2); // prints 11

The calculation order coincides with arithmetic rules. 
Multiplication has a higher priority level than addition and subtraction, 
so the operation 3 * 4 is calculated first.
To specify the order of execution we can use parentheses as in the following:

System.out.println((1 + 3) * (4 - 2)); // prints 8

---

This is a list of highest to lowest priorities; 


    parentheses
    unary plus/minus
    multiplication, division
    addition, subtraction
-----------------------

                  Feks 

System.out.println(2 + (-3) + 5 + (-8));

it will print: -4

------

System.out.println (10 / (2 + 2) + 4 * 8);

This will print: 34

--

System.out.println(2 + 4 * 5 - 10 / (2 + 1));

This will print: 19

--


System.out.println(-10 * (3 + 4) / 2);

this will print: -35

-----------------------------------

The forms of the assignment operator

If you want to add some value to a variable. You may write something like this:

int n = 10;
n = n + 4; // 14               
-- 

The assignment operator = has several forms which combine
it with an operation to avoid repeating the variable twice:

int n = 10;
n += 4; // 14

There are a few other possible forms *=, /=, %= and some others.

Here is how this type of code should look like:



import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        int a = scanner.nextInt();
        int b = scanner.nextInt();

        int sum = a + b;

        System.out.println(sum);
    }
}

--- or this: ---

import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        

        long a = scanner.nextLong();
        long b = scanner.nextLong();

        long sum = a + b; ))
        
        System.out.println(sum);
    }
}

-------------------------------------------

--- Task --- 

There are 2 squirelLs who wants to share their nuts with each other, equally
Divide so they can split it.

import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        int ekorn = scanner.nextInt();
        int nuts = scanner.nextInt();
        
        System.out.println(nuts / ekorn);
      
    }
}
