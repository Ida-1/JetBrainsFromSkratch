Once a variable has been declared, its value can be accessed and modified using the name. In the example below, we declare a variable and then print it:

String dayOfWeek = "Monday";
System.out.println(dayOfWeek); // Monday

It is also possible to assign a value of one variable to another one:

int one = 1;
int num = one;
System.out.println(num); // 1

                                           
                                              Feks
                                             -------
                                             
Let's declare a variable named dayOfWeek and print its value before and after changing:

String dayOfWeek = "Monday";
System.out.println(dayOfWeek); 

// It will print:  Monday

dayOfWeek = "Tuesday";
System.out.println(dayOfWeek); 

//It will print:  Tuesday

You can also: 
Declaring several variables of the same type as a single statement:

String language = "java", version = "8 or newer";

--  or eks --

int age; // declararing the variable
age = 35; // giving the variable the value

-- A brilliant example on this: --

int a = 10;
int b = 12;
int c = b;
int d = a;
int e = c;

Whats the value of e?

Since e = c. And c is equal as b. Since b is 12, that makes e 12!
