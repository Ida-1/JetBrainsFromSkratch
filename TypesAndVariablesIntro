Once a variable has been declared, its value can be accessed and modified using the name. In the example below, we declare a variable and then print it:

String dayOfWeek = "Monday";
System.out.println(dayOfWeek); // Monday

It is also possible to assign a value of one variable to another one:

int one = 1;
int num = one;
System.out.println(num); // 1

                                           
                                              Feks
                                             -------
                                             
Let's declare a variable named dayOfWeek and print its value before and after changing:

String dayOfWeek = "Monday";
System.out.println(dayOfWeek); 

// It will print:  Monday

dayOfWeek = "Tuesday";
System.out.println(dayOfWeek); 

//It will print:  Tuesday

You can also: 
Declaring several variables of the same type as a single statement:

String language = "java", version = "8 or newer";

--  or eks --

int age; // declararing the variable
age = 35; // giving the variable the value

-- A brilliant example on this: --

int a = 10;
int b = 12;
int c = b;
int d = a;
int e = c;

Whats the value of e?

Since e = c. And c is equal as b. Since b is 12, that makes e 12!

Given four variables. Assign values to these variables.
The variable one should be 1, two should be 2, three should be 3 and four should be 4.


class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        // Assign values to these four variables
        int one = 1;
        int two = 2; 
        int three = 3;
        int four = 4;

        System.out.println(String.format("%d %d %d %d", one, two, three, four));
    }
}
 
       When you use %d it will change out the value of the int. The first one wil go from the top, and then move itself downward. 


                       ("%d %d %d %d", one, two, three, four) will then be   "one two three four"
