Basic information 

Java provides several types of numbers as:
positive, negative and zero. 

Mostly Int and long are used. 

Int can store a smaller range than long. 

You can perform all arithmetic operations 
(+, -, *, /, %) with variables of integer types. 

--- Example --- 


int two = 2;
int ten = 10;

int twelve = two + ten; // 12
int eight = ten - two;  // 8
int twenty = two * ten; // 20
int five = ten / two;   // 5
int zero = ten % two;   // 0, no remainder

int minusTwo = -two; // -2

This demonstrates how to assign values to int variables 
as well as how to perform arithmetic operations with them. 

((To imporve readability you can add a "_", 
  to seperate the numbers, as;
  int million = 1_000_000))

  If a number ends with the letter L or l it is considered as long, otherwise, it is int.
  Use long's numbers only to process big values.
  
  --- Example ---
  
long one = 1L;
long twentyTwo = 22L; // L or l is a literal for longs
long bigNumber = 100_000_000_000L;

long result = bigNumber + twentyTwo - one; 
System.out.println(result); // 100000000021
